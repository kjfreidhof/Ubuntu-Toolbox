# Hello my name is kjfreidhof  

# and this is my Ubuntu toolbox

# This script is currently now Avalible to be used
# i am still working to make changes to it and make improvements as well these changes will be made monthly

# Their is also a setup script in the release tab their its just ment to setup and pull down the Ubuntu-toolbox
# repo and then install git 

# here is the link to the setup script
https://github.com/kjfreidhof/Ubuntu-Toolbox/releases/tag/Alpha1
  

# Their is 1 script as of now the ubuntu-toolbox.sh 

their is a 

ubuntu-toolbox.sh 

# I will most likely add more scripts to here overtime but for right now
# im just focused on the ubuntu0toolbox.sh 


# Prequisties

make sure you have git installed but i will probably make a setup script for this in the future also ill release this script as binary .zip and a tar ball so you can just download it and easily extract it 
with out needing git but do  
```
sudo apt install git
```

for ubuntu because ubuntu dies not have git installed by default 

# Then Lastly instructions do 
```
git clone https://github.com/kjfreidhof/Ubuntu-Toolbox.git
```
then 

```
sudo chmod +x ubuntu-toolbox.sh
```
then lastly
```
sudo ./ubuntu-toolbox.sh
```
# What is the future for this project

The future for this project is to well keep up with the recent changes in ubuntu and the changes made by 
Canonical. So that way i and anyone else who wishes to use this script can make ubuntu their own and at the end 
of the day the best opreating system is the one you make your own. In the next Release im going to focus on adding
office suite to this repo the ones that are avalible for linux of course and in the future adding the choice for a universal packaging format to install flatpak snap or appimage.
