# Hello my name is kjfreidhof  

# and this is my Ubuntu toolbox

# This script is currently in Alpha and i am working to make changes to it and make improvements as well
  

# Their is 1 script as of now the ubuntu-toolbox.sh 

their is a 

ubuntu-toolbox.sh 

# I will most likely add more scripts to here overtime but for right now
# im just focused on the ubuntu0toolbox.sh 


# Prequisties

make sure you have git installed but i will probably make a setup script for this in the future also ill release this script as binary .zip and a tar ball so you can just download it and easily extract it 
with out needing git but do  
```
sudo apt install git
```

for ubuntu because ubuntu dies not have git installed by default 

# Then Lastly instructions do 
```
git clone https://github.com/kjfreidhof/Ubuntu-Toolbox.git
```
then 

```
chmod +x ubuntu-toolbox.sh
```
then lastly
```
./ubuntu-toolbox.sh
```
